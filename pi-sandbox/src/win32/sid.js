/**
 * Deterministic capability SIDs for the Windows ACL sandbox backend.
 *
 * The per-workspace write identity is a `S-1-4-x-y` SID derived from the
 * canonical workspace path: a deterministic per-workspace identity, so every
 * confined execution of the same workspace — across sessions and restarts —
 * carries the SAME write SID and the standing workspace ACE materializes once
 * per workspace per machine. The temp write identity (`S-1-4-x-y-1`) is the
 * deterministic identity of the granted temp root — the host `%TEMP%`, never a
 * random private directory — whose fixed third sub-authority domain-separates
 * it from every two-sub-authority workspace SID, so the two capabilities can
 * never be confused. Neither identity carries session state: the runner
 * replays both grants idempotently across sessions and restarts, and both ACEs
 * are standing (never revoked).
 *
 * The callers pass canonical paths (`realpathSync.native`) — these functions
 * are pure and never touch the filesystem. `canonicalSidInput` only folds
 * spelling differences (separators, trailing separators, Windows case) so two
 * spellings of one directory derive one SID; NTFS is case-insensitive, so a
 * case difference must not mint a second half-granted capability. The folded
 * form is the canonical Windows spelling used for derivation: upper-case drive
 * letter, lower-case remainder. The derivation functions stay byte-sensitive
 * (the caller's contract), so the golden SID vectors pin the formula itself.
 *
 * Derivation ported verbatim from deepseek-harness (MIT):
 * packages/sandbox/sandbox-windows-acl/src/workspace-sid.ts.
