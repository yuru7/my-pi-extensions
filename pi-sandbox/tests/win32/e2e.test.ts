// pi-sandbox/tests/win32/e2e.test.ts
/**
 * Windows-only end-to-end suite (design spec §10.2). It drives the REAL runner
 * as a subprocess — real restricted token, real DACL grants, real kill-on-close
 * Job — and is therefore the only evidence in this repository that the Windows
 * confinement works outside the mocked Win32 binding table that Tasks 1-16 test
 * on Linux.
 *
 * Deliberate boundaries:
 *  - The child is always reached through
 *    `node <pkg>/src/win32/runner.js --workspace <ws> --temp <tmp> --mode <m> -- <argv...>`
 *    exactly like the production seam builds it. `runner.js` is never imported
 *    here — importing it would bypass the process boundary that is under test.
 *  - Cases that need a live pi session (PowerShell language mode, hard-link
 *    aliasing, the Job teardown of a timed-out grandchild, two-session
 *    isolation, the pi-side acceptance of an inactive `powershell` tool
 *    registration, and the diagnosis-skill catalog) are NOT faked here; they
 *    live in
 *    `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-10-03-windows-acl-acceptance.md`.
 *  - The `bash` refusal is a pure TypeScript-layer assertion, so it runs on
 *    every platform. It intentionally duplicates the focused assertions in
 *    `tests/confine.test.ts`: this file is the one place that maps spec §10.2
 *    to test cases, and a reader must not have to hunt for it.
 *  - Fixtures live under `os.homedir()`, never under `os.tmpdir()`: two cases
 *    grant the REAL `%TEMP%` as `--temp`, and that grant is inheritable and
 *    standing (design §4.7), so a fixture planted under `%TEMP%` would inherit
 *    the capability ACE on the next run and flip the denial cases green for the
 *    wrong reason. `assertFixtureRootOutsideTmpdir` turns that into a loud
 *    failure instead of a silent green.
 *  - Denial evidence is split: the non-zero exit and the host file's state
 *    (survival / non-creation) are the locale-independent proof of the
 *    boundary; the English-only denial dialects are asserted separately
 *    (`expectDenialDialect`) and only where the text comes from Node's own
 *    errno layer. On a localized Windows the `cmd`/PowerShell/.NET messages are
 *    localized — a classification gap, not a boundary gap; the acceptance
 *    checklist records it.
